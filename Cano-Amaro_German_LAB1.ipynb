    "If we raise the number of iteration of the perceptron algorithm over the training data the error will be considerably lower respect to the one obtained in the previous part for a given seed. On the other hand, the difference between the training and data error will be larger beeing greater the error for the test data. That happend most probably because having such accuracy on the training set leads to overfitting."
